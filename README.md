This is the my first REACT project. 
I have made the cards which contains the data of the tour package like place, price and description.

The above screenshot is the UI for my project.

#FUNCTIONALITY

In this project there is a button "Not Interested". If u will click on it, it will remove that card from your UI.
Basically, Filtering is applied here to do so.

As i have clicked on "Not Interested" button for Agra. UI will re-render and remove that card "Agra Card" from the UI as seen below in the SS.
